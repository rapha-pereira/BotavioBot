#### A Telegram Bot for answering your queries and scooping up the juiciest IFSC Campus Ca√ßador info! ü§ñ

## ü§î The Genesis of Botavio

Picture this: at IFSC Campus Ca√ßador, our Information Systems bachelor students faced not one, but two epic challenges:

- They struggled like knights searching for the Holy Grail to access **validation requests** and their statuses, especially when it came to specific course validations under the elusive "recognition of knowledge" premise.

- And then, like navigating a labyrinth blindfolded, they grappled with the mystery of **class schedules**.

Since a good amount of these folks were university process newbies, they fighted to find their way in this maze of information.

These informations were difficult to access as they were stored in a Google Sheets, making mobile access feel like searching for treasure without a map (or worse, trying to filter the Sheets by your name!).

To address these points, we developed a Telegram Bot that swiftly provides this information upon request. By simply interacting with the bot on Telegram, users can access these details within seconds.

Emphasizing accessibility and performance, we aimed for a cost-free solution that operates 24 hours, 7 days of the week. To achieve this, we opted for Google Apps Script as the host for the bot's server infrastructure.
